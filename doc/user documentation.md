#### **4. Saved Word List**

This place customizes vocabulary lists for each user! Once registered, each user will be assigned a blank saved word list. Users can save the foreign terms they want to practice/remember into this list. By switching between four language tabs, users can switch between French, Spanish, Dutch, and German modes.

**When adding words to the vocabulary list:**

##### **Getting Started**

If you don't know how to get started, try flashcards first! Every new user will be directed to the flash card page. You can also find "FLASHCARD" in the navigation bar. View flashcards and add interested terms to the saved word list.

##### **Having a specific word in mind?** 

Use the "Add New Word" function in the Saved Words List:

1. Spell the foreign term in the first box and click the "Add New Word" function.
2. If the foreign term is present in our database dictionary, you don't need to fill in the "English Translation" box, we will automatically show the definition.

##### **Adding a foreign term but forgetting its spelling?**

We got you! If the foreign term is included in the database dictionary, the spelling check will guide you through the spelling!

**Want to save a word that's not found in the dictionary?**

If the foreign term is not found in the database dictionary, the user can still include the term in the list, by spelling out the term in the "Type a Foreign Word" box, and customize its definition in "English Translation". Click the "Add New Word" button to save.

##### **Note:**

Usually, there's no duplicated words in the saved word list. But for customized words (words not in dictionary), users can save repeated foreign terms, thus enabling them to separately memorize different meanings of a word.
